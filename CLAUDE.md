## Development Rules

- Keep SKILL.md files under 500 lines / 5000 tokens
- Reference files should be focused and under 200 lines
- Scripts must have docstrings, CLI interface, and JSON output
- Follow kebab-case naming for all skill directories
- Agents invoked via Task tool with `context: fork`, never via Bash
- No hardcoded credentials; use MCP servers for external API access
